There's not a lot of information about Redux Toolkit. The websites that do provide information are not in depth and leave more questions than answers. In order to solve this problem I made Blockheads, an API heavy News dashboard featuring real-time blockchain and crypto industry news resources --aggregated onto a single platform for easy access.

I've been searching for a good crypto portfolio to use personally. I've decided to implement a database and server-side logic and upgrade Blockheads into a full-stack app with security validation, privacy features, and a beginner friendly customizable personal portfolio for anyone interested! I firmly believe we developers need to do a better job bulding intuitive Dapps for non-tech people. Stay Tuned!
