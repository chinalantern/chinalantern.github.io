There's not a lot of information out there about Redux Toolkit. To solve this problem, I made Blockheads. Blockheads is an API-heavy News dashboard featuring real-time blockchain and crypto industry news resources -aggregated onto a single platform for easy access.

I've personally been searching for a good crypto portfolio to use. I've decided to implement a database plus server-side logic and upgrade Blockheads into a full-stack Dapp with security validation and privacy features. My goal: It will be a beginner-friendly personal portfolio for anyone interested! I believe we developers need to do a better job building intuitive Web3 Dapps for non-tech people. Stay Tuned!
