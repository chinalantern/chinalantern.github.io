Having been frustrated with the user experence + interface (UI/UX) and esoteric implementations of current Web3 Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), I've decided to build a full-stack social-good DOA. My goal is to abstract away the jargon, technology, and cryptic experiences and deliver a fluid, accessible, community-based experience in exchange.

Smash Factory is a proof-of-concept for the DAO's media engine micro-service.
